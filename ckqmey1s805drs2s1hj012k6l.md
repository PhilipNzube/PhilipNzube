## My Experience In The SideHustle Internship

My experience in the internship has been good, matter of fact,<strong>GREATðŸ˜‰</strong>. 
I have learnt a lot from it, like, most of the languages used in GitHub.
I created my GitHub account last year but had problems with some of
the words used e.g. commit,which means save. And I usually wasn't
interested in using codepen, but the internship made me to.
My best experience was the hosting of a site that we were asked to create. When i first saw the site that we were asked to create, it wasn't a new thing actually cause I have been used to creating what people want but this one,even though it wasn't a fully functional site, had a sick style. It had the kind of colour(Perfect Dark Blue) that I had been looking for like for up to to three months now. But to be honest, creating that webpage wasn't easyðŸ˜€. I had a little trouble perfecting the Page's look for mobile devices but I still did it even though it wasn't perfect. Night time is always my best time for coding and that's what helped me complete my web pageðŸ˜‰. And it started getting easier from pushing my files to my GitHub repository, to hosting of my site on Netlify.
<em>I never knew that hosting a site was that easy</em>ðŸ˜Š.<strong> Here is the link to my site:"https://philwebdev.netlify.app"</strong>ðŸ˜‡.In summary, this internship is awesome,no lie, and I hope to keep discovering new thingsðŸ’†ðŸ™Œ.
